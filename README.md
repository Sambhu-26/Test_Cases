A test case is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether an application, system, or specific feature
is working as intended. It includes the steps to be executed, the expected outcomes, and any preconditions that need to be met.
Test cases are essential for systematic and thorough testing of software to ensure its quality and functionality.

Here's an example of a test case for an input box:

Test Case for Input Box Validation:

Test Case ID: TC_InputBox_001
Objective: To verify that the input box accepts valid input and displays an appropriate response for invalid input.

Preconditions:
    The application is launched and accessible.
    The input box is visible on the screen.

Test Steps:
    Enter a valid input (e.g., "John Doe") into the input box.
    Press the "Submit" or equivalent button.
    Verify that the application processes the input correctly and responds as expected (e.g., navigates to the next page, displays a success message).

Expected Outcome: The application should accept valid input, process it correctly, and provide the expected response.

Test Steps:

    Enter an invalid input (e.g., special characters, numbers in a name field) into the input box.
    Press the "Submit" or equivalent button.
    Verify that the application displays an appropriate error message or indication that the input is invalid.

Expected Outcome: The application should reject invalid input, display a clear error message, and not proceed with further processing.

Test Steps:

    Leave the input box empty.
    Press the "Submit" or equivalent button.
    Verify that the application displays an appropriate error message indicating that the input is required.

Expected Outcome: The application should not accept an empty input, display a relevant error message, and prompt the user to provide the required information.

Postconditions: The application should return to a stable state after each test, and the input box should be ready for the next test.
